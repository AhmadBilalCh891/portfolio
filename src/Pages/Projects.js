GitHub did an excellent job, you can have a single cloud-hosted source of your source code control, and then you build an ecosystem of tools and people and tasks around it. And everyoneâ€™s always pointing to GitHub. ProductHub does the same by centralizing designs and manufacturing of hardwares. You can manage and compare different versions of your hardware. I have worked on this porject while working with a client.'
